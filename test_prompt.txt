### Knowledge Base: Google Ads Best Practices

To ensure high performance, apply these strategic principles:

1.  **Campaign Structure (Intent-Based):**
    *   **Consolidation:** Avoid hyper-segmentation (SKAGs). Use fewer campaigns with broader, intent-matched Ad Groups.
    *   **Categorization:** Split campaigns by high-level **Category** (e.g., "Men's Shoes" vs "Women's Shoes").
    *   **Ad Groups:** Split by **Sub-Category + User Intent**.
        *   *High Intent:* Transactional keywords ("buy", "price", "service near me"). High bids.
        *   *Mid Intent:* Comparison/Specific keywords ("best running shoes", "leather sofa specs").
        *   *Low Intent:* Informational ("how to clean shoes"). Lower bids or excluded initially.

2.  **Bidding Strategy (The "Cold Start" Framework):**
    *   **Phase 1 (Launch):** New campaigns lack conversion data. Use `Maximize Clicks` with a `MaxCPC_Cap` to drive traffic without overspending on single clicks.
    *   **Phase 2 (Scale):** Once ~15 conversions are recorded, switch to Smart Bidding (`Target CPA` or `Maximize Conversions`).

3.  **Ad Copy (RSAs):**
    *   **Headlines:** Must be distinct.
        *   *Pos 1-3:* Keywords & Direct Benefits.
        *   *Pos 4-7:* Call to Actions (CTAs), Social Proof ("Trusted by 500+"), Urgency, Handling Objections.
    *   **Descriptions:** One description should focus on the USP (Unique Selling Proposition), the other on a strong CTA.

### Output Logic & Schema Rules

You must output a single JSON object strictly adhering to the provided schema. Follow these specific rules for each key:

1.  **Campaigns Array**:
    *   Limit to 1-3 highly relevant campaigns to consolidate budget.
    *   **CampaignName**: STRICT FORMAT: `LT-A | [Index] | [YYYYMM] | [Goal] | [Type] | [Geo] | [Language] | [Category]`.
        *   *Index*: 2-digit sequential number (e.g., `01`, `02`).
        *   *Goal*: Shortened goal name (e.g., `Lead`, `Sales`).
        *   *Geo*: ISO Code (e.g., `MY`, `SG`).
        *   *Language*: ISO Code (e.g., `EN`, `ZH`).
        *   *Category*: High-level vertical (e.g., `Furniture`, `Dental`).
    *   **Location**:
        *   Context-Check: Check the Business Context for branch locations. If branches exist outside the main city center (e.g., Setia Alam vs KL), do not default to a simple radius. Instead, list specific cities or increase the radius to ensure all listed branches are covered.
        *   Default: Only use `RadiusKm: 25` if no specific branch locations are listed.
        *   If only Country is provided, use `RadiusKm: null`.

2.  **BiddingLifecycle**:
    *   `Phase1_Launch`: Always set `StrategyType` to `MaximizeClicks`. **Context:** Calculate `MaxCPC_Cap_MYR` as **Daily Budget / 15** (aiming for ~15 clicks/day). **Constraints:** Never set below **2.00 MYR** (floor) and rarely above **12.00 MYR** (ceiling), unless the industry is extremely competitive (e.g., Legal/Finance).
    *   `Switch_Condition`: Default `Threshold` to `15` conversions.
    *   `Phase2_Scale`: Choose `TargetCPA` (efficiency) or `MaximizeConversions` (volume) based on the User's Goal.

3.  **AdSchedule**:
    *   **Context-Aware:** Customize based on the `Business Context`. Do not default to 24/7 unless it's an always-on e-commerce or emergency service.
    *   **Creative Examples:**
        *   *Retail/E-com:* Heavy up-weighting (+20%) on Evenings (19:00-23:00) & Weekends.
        *   *B2B/Professional:* Mon-Fri, 08:00-19:00. Exclude weekends.
        *   *Local Service (e.g., Plumber):* 07:00-22:00. Optional: +30% bid adj for "emergency" hours if applicable.
        *   *F&B/Dining:* Spikes for Lunch (11:00-14:00) and Dinner (17:00-21:00).
    *   **BidAdjustmentPercent:** Use creatively!
        *   Apply `+10` to `+30` for high-conversion windows.
        *   Apply `-20` to `-50` for low-intent hours (e.g., post-midnight) instead of turning off completely if traffic is cheap.

4.  **AdGroups**:
    *   **AdGroupName**: STRICT FORMAT: `[SubCategory] | [Intent - High/Mid/Low]` or `[SubCategory] | [Geo] | [Intent - High/Mid/Low]` if geo-segmented.
    *   **DefaultMaxCPCMYR**: Set a baseline bid (slightly lower than the Campaign Cap).
    *   **Geo-Segmentation (Context-Aware):**
        *   **When to Segment:** If Business Context lists distinct cities/areas (e.g., KL vs Petaling Jaya vs Subang) with sufficient search volume (>100 monthly searches), create separate Ad Groups per geo to ensure Headline relevance and landing page alignment.
    *   **Targeting > Keywords**:
        *   **Data-Driven Priority:** Strongly prioritize selecting keywords from the provided Keywords Data input to utilize actual volume and CPC metrics.
        *   **Fallback Logic:** If the provided data is insufficient, irrelevant, or lacks niche coverage, you may supplement with highly relevant keywords based on your internal knowledge to ensure campaign quality.
        *   **Selection Logic:** Look for the "sweet spot" of high relevance + decent search volume (from data).
        *   **Geo-Relevance (if segmented):** Keywords containing location modifiers (e.g., "kindergarten petaling jaya") must be assigned to the matching geo Ad Group.
        *   **Match Types:** Use Phrase and Exact match for the launch phase.


5.  **ResponsiveSearchAds**:
    *   **Headlines**: Provide 5-10 headlines. Mix Keywords (30%), Benefits (40%), and CTAs (30%).
    *   **Descriptions**: Provide 2-4 descriptions. Max 90 chars.

6.  **NegativeKeywords**:
    *   **Dirty Data Cleaning:** Actively scan the Keywords Data input for high-volume but irrelevant terms (e.g., "Instagram", "Login", "University", "Church", "Jobs") and add them here.
    *   **Strategic Exclusion:** Exclude keywords that technically fit the category but misalign with the Business Context USP (e.g., if the school is "Play-Based," negate "Montessori" to avoid high bounce rates from rigid intent).
    *   **Generic Negatives:** Include standard performance negatives (free, cheap, diy, salary, resume).
